# Weekly report 2  

## What did I do this week?  
- Implemented the data structure of a cube (5 hours)  
- Set up GitHub Actions and Codecov (1 hour)  
- UI with almost all of the required features (2 hour)  
- A simple script for testing and style checking (0.5 hours)  
- A simple script for running the program (0.5 hours)  

## Progress on the program  
- It's now possible to play with the Rubik's cube  

## What did I learn?  
- I learned how to test Python code.  
- I should probably never even try to do this for the megaminx. (I might still
  try it though, just because why not)  

## Challenges?
- Rotations of the cube were quite difficult to get right.  
- The algorithms for optimal Rubik's cube solutions seem to be a bit more
  difficult to implement than I expected but I will not give up.  
- I expected to have a lot more time than I actually had.  

## Next week
- Implement Kociemba's algorithm  
- Optimize the data structure of the cube?
