# Weekly report 3  

## What did I do this week?  
- Prevent Kociemba from checking moves like U D U' where U and U' would just
  cancel out each other as there is just D between them. (0.5 hours)  

## Progress on the program  
- 

## What did I learn?  
- 

## Challenges?  
- Python is quite slow :) I should have gone with C++ or Rust instead.
