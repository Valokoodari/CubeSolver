# Weekly report 4  

## What did I do this week?  
| Date  | Time (h) | Task
| :---: | :---     | :---
| 1.6.  | 0.5      | Improved duplicate check prevention for Kociemba's. (Prevent checking of ```U D U'``` (same as just ```D```) and ```R' L2 R2``` (same as ```R L2```) for example.)
|       | 1.5      | Functions for Kociemba's coordinates for pruning.
|       | 1        | Reading and trying to understand the coordinates.
|       | 1        | Writing tests and manual testing.
| 2.6.  | 0.5      | This table to replace the old list.
|       | 0.5      | Even better duplicate prevention. (For example: only check ```L R``` or ```R L```, never both.)
|       | 0.5      | Remember cubes which have already been checked.
|       | 0.5      | Combine Kociemba's __phase1 and __phase2 to only be one function __search with different check function and moveset.
|       | 0.5      | Style fixes and manual testing.
| Total | 6.5      |

## Challenges?
