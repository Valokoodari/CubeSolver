| Date  | Time (h) | Task
| :---: | :---     | :---
| 7.6.  | 1        | Slight cleaning of the Kociemba's algorithm
|       | 0.5      | Few more tests for the cube
|       | 0.5      | Thinking about the pruning tables
|       | 1.5      | Thinking how to index edge patters for Korf's algorithm
| 9.6.  | 1.5      | Calculation of edge pattern indexes for Korf's algorithm
|       | 0.5      | Scrapped refactoring
| Total | 3.5      |

## Progress on the program  
- Not yet :(

## What did I learn?  
- How to calculate an index for permutation of set (1,2,3,\_,\_,\_) for example.
  (Partial permutation? not sure, came up with a method by myself :D)  

## Challenges?  
- Calculating the index for partial permutations.  
- Generating the tables will take a lot of time...  

## Next week  
- Cleaning up the code
