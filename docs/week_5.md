|       | 1.5      | Began to implement the pruning tables
| 11.6. | 1        | Pylint and instructions for Cubbli
|       | 2        | Peer review
|       | 1        | Fixing the code style with the help of pylint
|       | 1        | Tried to add a pylint badge
| Total | 11       |

## Progress on the program  
- Began implementing the tables and ran into some problems.  

## What did I learn?  
- How to calculate an index for permutation of set (1,2,3,\_,\_,\_) for example.
  (Partial permutation? not sure, came up with a method by myself :D)  

## Challenges?  
- Calculating the index for partial permutations.  
- I haven't figured out how to calculate the sym-coordinates for Kociemba's
  algorithm. And I'd rather have pruning tables measured in megabytes instead of
  gigabytes  
- Generating the tables will take a lot of time...  

## Next week  
- Figure out the sym-coordinates for Kociembas pruning tables...  
- Make pruning tables smaller in memory and as files  
- Generate the pruning tables  
- Finish both algorithms in terms of functionality.
