# Weekly report 3  

## What did I do this week?  
- Improved the scrambling of the cube (0.5 hours)  
- Implemented a "brute force" version of Kociemba's phase 2. (2 hours)  
- Implemented a "brute force" version of Kociemba's phase 1. (1 hour)  
- Slight changes to the data structure of the cube and to the UI. (1 hour)  
- Research from Kociemba's website and some other sources. (4 hours)  
- Testing for the algorithms (1 hour)
- Testing for the datastructures (1 hour)

## Progress on the program  
- Brute force (ID search without pruning and A*) Kociemba's phase 2.  
- The same partly brute forcing of Kociemba's phase 1.  

## What did I learn?  
- How IDA* works and that it was first described by Richard Korf.  
- (I have the time management skills of a carrot)  

## Challenges?  
- I'm not sure how to implement the pruning tables  
- The current solution for phase2 is somewhat viable for anything requiring 6
  moves or less and the phase1 is somewhat viable for anything requiring 5 moves
  or fewer to group <U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2>.  

## Next week
- Pruning tables for Kociemba's algorithm  
- Add the A* part of IDA* to Kociemba's  
- Multithreading?  
- Better testing for algorithms
