## Progress on the program  
- A way to run the program without generating the pruning tables.  
- About 30 % performance improvement with the rewritten CubeFace class.  

## What did I learn?  
- Even bitwise operations won't help too much with performance.  

## Challenges?  
- The performance is still quite poor.
