## What did I do this week?  
| Date  | Time (h) | Task
| :---: | :---     | :---
| 21.6. | 1.5      | Getting ready for tomorrow's demo
|       | 1        | Update documentation
| 22.6. | 2        | More preparations for the demo.
|       | 2        | The demo session
|       | 3        | 32-bit integer based CubeFace
| 25.6. | 2        | Update documentation
|       | 1.5      | Solve top cross with the simple algorithm
| 26.6. | 1.5      | Solve top corners with the simple algorithm
| Total | 14.5     |

## Progress on the program  
- A way to run the program without generating the pruning tables.  
- About 30 % performance improvement with the rewritten CubeFace class.  
- The simple algorithm is now able to solve the top layer.  

## What did I learn?  
- Even bitwise operations won't help too much with performance.  

## Challenges?  
- The performance is still quite poor.
