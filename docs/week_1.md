# Weekly report 1  

## What did I do this week?  
- Did some testing to find out how to easily test Python code. (3 hours)  
- Came up with the idea for this project. (? hours)  
- Created the GitHub repository. (0 hours)  
- Wrote the [project specification document](specification.md). (1 hour)  

## Progress on the program  
- No programming yet.  

## What did I learn?  
- How to test Python code with pytest  
- How to use pytest-cov for test coverage.  

## Challenges?
- Coming up with an idea that I actually liked was quite difficult and I
  changed my mind multiple times before actually deciding.  
- I didn't have enough time for research to actually finish the project
  specification.

## Next week
- The base of the actual program with some kind of primitive UI.  
- Improve the project specification.
