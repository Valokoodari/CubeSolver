# Project Specification  
### Tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandidaatti (TKT)  
### Project language: english  

This program is for comparing a few different ways to find a solution for a 
Rubik's cube. The comparison includes the time to find a solution and the
amount of turns in the solution. The program is written in Python.

## Data structures  
- TBD

## Algorithms  
- My own algorithm based on how I solve a cube  
  - Solves the cube layer by layer
  - A lot of moves
- Thistletwaite's algorithm  
- Kociemba's algorithm  
- Korf's algorithm  

## Expected time and space complexity
- Unknown

## Input / Output  
### Input  
- The state of the puzzle or a random scramble.  

### Output  
- A list of moves to solve the puzzle
